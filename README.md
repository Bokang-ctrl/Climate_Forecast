# Jena Climate Forecasting

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on climate forecasting using the Jena dataset. The project demonstrates data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling for time series forecasting.

Contents
Jena_Climate_Forecasting.ipynb: The main notebook with detailed steps for climate data analysis and forecasting.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow 

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and preparing the data for modeling.
Visualization: Graphical representation of climate variables over time.
Modeling: Implementing and evaluating machine learning models for forecasting.

Models Used

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): An advanced RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies, particularly useful for time series data.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A deep learning model that can capture spatial patterns, adapted here to capture temporal patterns in the time series data.
